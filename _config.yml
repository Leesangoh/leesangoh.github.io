I am a third-year Ph.D. student at  <a href='https://dslab.postech.ac.kr' target='_blank'>DSLab</a>@<a href='https://postech.ac.kr' target='_blank'>POSTECH</a>, under the supervision of Professor Wook-Shin Han. My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, with a particular focus on advancing VLA capabilities. Previously, my work centered on graph data analytics (such as graph pattern cardinality estimation), efficient join processing, query optimization, and AI for Databases (AI4DB). I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from POSTECH. I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at POSTECH.
